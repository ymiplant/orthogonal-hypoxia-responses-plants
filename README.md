MATLAB code for simulations in “Prolyl hydroxylase-dependent proteolysis enables orthogonal hypoxia responses in plants”

Note:
The scripts in this repository generate the raw simulation plots underlying Figures 4A and 4B and Supplementary FigureS10B. 
Final figures in the published manuscript were graphically refined (e.g., layout, fonts, labeling) using CorelDRAW.
